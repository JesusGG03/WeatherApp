<h1>Weather App</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Weather App is a basic, minimalist project. Using React Native and Expo, I am able to simulate it on my Iphone from a Windows computer. This project is meant to serve as a learning experience,
rather than showing off what I know (I don't know much about Native). I have also created Figma wireframes to get a visual understanding of what I want the app to look like. I plan to integrate
API's that show the weather for a given area and the weather for the following days. I don't plan on putting this out in mobile stores, but if it is something I am proud of, I don't see why not

<h2>Technologies and Concepts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Languages: TSX</li>
  <li>Frameworks: React, React Native</li>
  <li>Technologies: Expo, Expo CLI</li>
</ul>

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
This project serves as a learning experience. I would like to learn through hands on experience rather than looping through tutorials. This might lead to a longer learning period, but information
will be retained and engrained better. Some objectives include:
<ul>
  <li>TSX and its syntax</li>
  <li>React Native and its many libraries</li>
  <li>API implementation in React Native</li>
  <li>Possible learning how to deploy on mobile stores</li>
  <li>User interaction</li>
</ul>

<h2>Feature Checklist</h2>
This checklist is meant for features that I plan to implement
<ul>
  <li>- [ ] User Interface</li>
  <li>- [ ] Weather API</li>
  <li>- [ ] Geo API</li>
</ul>
